=================================================
Purpose:
	-This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviours

Highlights:
	1. Gather essential fields such as names, ages and transaction details.
	2. Segments customers into categories (VIP, Regular, New) and age groups.
	3. Aggregates customer-level metrics:
		- total orders,
		- total sales,
		- total quantity purchased,
		- total products,
		- lifespan in months.
	4. Calculates valuable KPI's:
		- recency (months since last order)
		- average order value
		- average monthly spend
